# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge

Hello!

This is the week 2 challenge program focused on data processing of many different stocks.
I have included the workbook along with the vba program (as a separate file) necessary to perform the calculations specified by the challenge.

There are also screenshots of what the finished results look like upon execution of the calculation program.

Simply tab over to the developer tools tab, select macros, and the vba script should be there for you to run.

I hope the analysis performed by this program is helpful!
